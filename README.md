# README
This game is like 2 cars, but with 3 cars!

Compiled using `g++ v13.1.0` (built by MinGw) using `SFML v2.6.0` on Windows 11.

The DLLs were built from the source by me, and the include files are copied from the sources.

Just add the `/lib` directory to the `$PATH` environment variable and you're good to go, or just move/copy them to the local directory.

I compile the game using `build.ps1`

It looks shit but it's there ...
